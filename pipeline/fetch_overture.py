"""Download the Overture Maps extracts that southcarolina.py reads -> data/sc/

- overture_sc_bbox.parquet     every place in South Carolina's bounding box (name, category, address, point)
- overture_sc_sources.parquet  which datasets each South Carolina eating/drinking listing came from (Meta, Foursquare, ...)
- sc_shapes.json               simplified state and county outlines for the map
- sc_state_detail.geojson      the state outline at full detail, for the in-state test

Reads the public Overture bucket over S3 with DuckDB (no account needed). Adapted from wi-eats/pipeline/fetch_overture.py
(South Carolina: the Atlantic shoreline and the Savannah River border come from the land division areas).
